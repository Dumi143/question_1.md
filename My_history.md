#About me, 

I am Dumisani  Mafenya Mbombi, I stay at Thulani Doornkop Dobsonville, I live in a household of two which is me and my sister (Masane Mbombi). I lost my mother when I was in grade 3 in 2005. I lost my father in 2020 during the pandemic. A single parent raised me for most of my childhood, my father was a taxi driver so we had to make do with the little income that he generated. My sister went on to study Policing at the Vaal University of Technology.
Since finance was tight in high school I worked at my uncle's shop for extra income and I also sold cakes and fish to generate more income, I have always had a mind for business which is what has driven me for most of my life. 
In grade 10  I was selected to be one of the  attendees of the Pro-maths project where they assisted the students in advancing their skills in Mathematics 
, Science and Accounting. After completing high school I worked part-time at Kutlwanong(Pro-math) as a data capture, and then I went on to work at Wits University Press as a Marketing assistant. I then went to work at Transactional Capital Recoveries as a marketing administrator.
